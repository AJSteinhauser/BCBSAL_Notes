Paragraph
: COBOL procedure structure comprised of statements

COBOL does not support event driven processes. Transaction processing systems CICS and IMS have provided feature to allow similar processing

> COBOL is a procedural language. Action flow in orders determined by the programming. COBOL today can receive user input and appear to be event driven. But still based on procedural programming

Modern COBOL introduces Object oriented structures. They can be compiled into byte code and accessed from other languages such as Java
