# Lesson 3

Health plans strive to give patients the "Right care, right setting, at the right time". They achieve this they structure the plan to support medical functions o achieving this goal

Breakdown of any parts of the triangle results in damage to other side of the triangle

Teams focused different aspects of the triangle

Cost
: Keep medical costs reasonable for clients

Access
: Improve accessability to medical care

Quality
: Improve the quality of medical services available to members

Medical department determines most of the patient affecting decisions are


## Clinical quality

Turing data into quality medical care
Clinical quality teams turn the data acquired from the insurance industry take the data and turn it into valuable information that allows companies to adjust insurance plans and coverage for the best possible output for those under their coverage

Evidence based medicine
: **EBM** from experimentation and and physician recommendations. Clinical quality teams use that data with a committee of physicians to debate, revise, and approve the health plans medical policies. 

Clinical Pathway
: A series of medical services for many conditions diseases and injuries, so the right care is almost always defined. **The right care means enough but not too much care**

Right Care
: Research has proven that more medical care is not necessarily better. Often times leads to lower costing care for the same output when the right amount of care is applied. 

Accreditation and quality scoring
: Undergoes screening of their operating procedures to determine if they meet the criteria as defined by the accrediting body

Accreditation
: Complex and includes audits that in compliance with state and federal regulations. They also establish requirements for health plan performance such as how clinical decisions are made, timely access to treatment, ext...

Government rating
: Ceterns for medicare and medicaid services (CMS) bases its reimbursement based on "Star ratings program"

Star Ratings Program
: 0-5 stars in 45 areas that fall within several areas
    * Outcomes
    * intermediate outcomes
    * Patient experience 
    * Complains
    * Access
    * Process

## Utilization Management Function


Utilization Management Function
: **UM** team to explain and interpret medical polices set out by clinical team


Utilization Management Staff
: Registered nurses, physical therapist, social workers, and behavioral/mental health clinical 


Medical Necessity
: Services or supplies required to treat a certain medical condition approved by a doctor 
    * Drug 
    * Device
    * Treatment plan
    * other therapy


#### Medical Necessity Decision Flow

1. Gather medical information from providers office 
2. Identify best practices, match requested care to best practices treatment
3. Make Decision, made ultimately by medical plan's medical director (who are licensed physicians)
4. Communicate decision

Case Management
: Most UM departments have units devoted to this. Usually have additional accreditation than just register nurse. Help patients with acute or chronic illnesses and arrange/manage their medical care. Ideally have proactive outreach to chronically or acutely ill patients to ensure appropriate follow up

#### Case Management Decision Flow

1. Arrange Surgery
2. Arrange home care 
3. Arrange rehab and follow up visits
4. Optimal patient outcome 


Care management
: Cross between case management and population health management

Care manager act as both proactive and reactive resources for an insured population. It can be considered a Concierge-type service

##### Care management is valuable for 2 reason
1. Ensures broader application of right care, right setting, and right time
2. Personal touch may increase member satisfaction  

## Population Health Management  
**(PHM)**

80-20 Rule
: 20% of the members will account for 80% of the cost of medical care

Population Health Management
: Focus on improving the health and wellness of patients who suffer from chronic illness that put a large burden on the entire health care system 
* Often times insure agency's outsource this to PHM programs

PHM chronic illnesses:
* Diabetes
* Hypertension
* Asthma 
* Back pain
* High cholesterol 
* Depression 

PHM Staff Roles 
1. Identify Candidates  
2. Conduct outreach to engage them in proactively managing their chronic illness 
3. Handle acute episodes

PHM Theory
: Keeping members healthy is beneficial for both individuals and the greater health care community over the long run 

## Pharmacy Benefit Management 

In the last 20 years pharmacy costs have escalated dramatically. To combat this health plans rely on entities know as **Pharmacy Benefit Managers**

They are third party administrators for health plans that negotiate discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and keep list of covered prescription drugs **(Formulary)**

Most health plans have an internal pharmacy department staffed by licensed pharmacists. They set pharmacy policy and determines the health plans formulary

Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee
: Reviews and selects new and existing medications to be included in teh plan formulary based on safety and success criteria

Self-funded Medical coverage
: Employers will sometimes self fund specific non formulary drugs. They PBM will look at costs and recommend changes to health plans to enable the employers to offer that specific treatment
