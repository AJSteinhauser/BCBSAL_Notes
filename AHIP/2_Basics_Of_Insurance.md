Insurance
: Protection against loss
: Financial protection against loss or harm in return for the payment of a premium

Medical Coverage
: Doctor bills, diagnostic tests and pharmaceutical and hospital costs

Other types of health insurance 
* Disability 
* long-term care

Most people get health insurance through their employers known as group health insurance. 

*Once you enroll in a group plan, you cannot change to another plan until the next open enrollment season which is once a year*

Different options for different groups
* Managed Care
* Fee-For-Service insurance
* Dental insurance
* Vision insurance

When in group health insurance the employer usually pays a portion of the premium leading to lower costs for the individual


Group Membership
: Large groups benefit the individual however % of premium payed by organization varies 

Individual health insurance
: Purchase on your own from health insurance marketplace. They are responsible for paying the entire premium. Important to ensure the plan fits their needs. *The affordable care act sometimes helps people with premiums depending on income level*

Premium tax credit
: When going through **Individual health insurance** they may qualify for this. They can use all or a portion of their **Advanced premium tax credit (APTC)** to lower their premium costs. *Must not overcharge premium or they will have to pay the difference later*

Self-Employed
: Deduct their health insurance premiums from their federal taxable income providing them with savings. Most states offer similar tax preferences.

Contract:
: An agreement between the insurer and the insured is based on contract. An agreement with specific terms in return for a valuable benefit, known as consideration.

Health Insurance Policy
: A contract with health insurance. The consideration is the premium payments made by employer to insurer

Eligibility
: Identify who is able to get insured

Subscriber
: Person who buys or is provided insurance 

Dependant
: Other people who are covered by the subscriber 

Covered Service
: Insurance will pay for 

Exclusions
: Things the insurance company will not pay for

*Health insurance cover both preventive as well as reactive services*

Cost-sharing
: The insured can be expected to pay some but not all of the costs of medical care. The amount depends on how the policy is written.

Deductible
: Flat rate the insured must pay before the insurer will make any payments

Coinsurance
: The % of a medical bill that the insured is responsible for paying

Copayment
: Fixed about you agree to pay to receive benefit or coverage from insurance policy

#### Differences in selecting plans
* Individuals can choose a plan that covers the amount of coverage they want or need
* In employer sponsored plans they choose the the amount of coverage offered to their employees  
* Government sponsored plans
    * Medicare covers those > 65 and younger people with disabilities or severe kidney problems
    * Medicaid covers low income individuals

* Evidence of coverage booklet
    * Booklet from the insurance company, for all intents and purposes, it is the member contract
    * Identifies amount of care costs and amount of cost-sharing  

## The Health Insurance Contract

#### Risk
Insured individuals often expect insurance company to cover all procedures. However only things listed in contract are covered, if you want more coverage then you can pay more for a more inclusive coverage

Situations where health care services are not covered is hard for employee sponsored group health plan members. It is the duty of the companies HR to provide information about health care services to employees. 

**Most disagreements come from insured not reading or understanding their health care contract**

Some services may be explicits excluded from the health contract, experiments treatments, non-contracted provider, elective or cosmetic surgery 

**Experimental treatments are generally not covered by the health contract**
If every type of medical care was covered then the insurance company could not keep the price regulated as experimental treatments are expensive and not always worth the time or money. Insurance targets the general needs of a community not the far end of a bell curve 

Non-contracts providers
: Providers who do not have a contract with the the health insurance company and thus the health insurance plan will not cover care from that group


## Health care philosophy

Balancing the cost of care with the quality of health care. More expensive health care != higher quality of care

People want low cost high quality health care whenever they want. The balance must be struck between cost quality and access

Quality
: More care != better outcomes

Access
: Due to high costs of health care, without insurance health care is hard to get. Providers are more willing to provide care without upfront payment when you have an insurance plan

Cost
: Fee-For-Service providers get paid for each unit of medical service they provide

## Managed care and provider networks

Until the 1970's insurance could only improve two variables of the triangle at the same time. The federal government encourage the development of health maintenance organizations to improve all three variables at the same time...

How managed care improved health care: 

Cost 
: Created limited provider networks, paying physicians in different ways than fee-for-service and requiring referrals from a primary care doctor to get specialty care.

Quality
: Credentialing providers, enforcing evidence based medical policies, grading providers on their outcomes, and comparing providers results to their peers

Access
: As managed care improved both costs and quality, premium costs were controlled better and thus more accessible to the community 

Annual increase in premiums was a result of governmental limitations, higher provider fees, increased use of technology in delivery of care, health care fraud, and other administration costs

Provider networks
: Some plans require people to use doctors, hospitals, labs, pharmacies, and other providers that are "in" their proprietary networks

#### Categories of provider networks

Closed network
: Only providers that are within the network will be covered except in case of emergency

Open network 
: There is no limits on who can give you medical care
 
Defined network with out-of-network coverage
: Have a defined network to use, providers that are out of network will need to pay a higher amount of of costs 

#### Contract provider networks

Quality control
: Credentialing providers keeps malpractice out of network. Keeps quality up and costs lower for everyone 

Cost Control
: Negotiate fee payments for those in network in exchange for a higher patient volume. Makes cost more predictable

Addressing population health issues
: Focus on population health issues buy communication or with action/outcome based payment incentives
