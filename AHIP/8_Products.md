: **(CDHC)** Plans that allow HSA or HRA to pay providers directly for their health needs

**How CDHC works:**
1. Client puts aside money is savings plan
2. Expenses will come from their pre-funded spending account
3. If the amount of money is > than the amount set aside, then the member pays regular deductible 
4. If there is unused balance then it rolls over into the next year.
5. HDHP protects them from catastrophic medical expenses

## Government programs/products    

### Traditional Medicare

For people > 65 years old or those who are permanently disabled and those with end-stage renal disease

It is essentially a fee for service plan. It is over seen by **CMS** health insured plans are hired by cms to process and pay the claims from medical providers. They do not take on insurance risk, only administrative services

Medicare Advantage (Part C)
: They can opt for coverage through a private company that offers MA plans. CMS regulates these plans carefully

Often times no premium. May be structured on HMO or PPO plans.
MA plans are required by law to offer at minimum all benefits that medicare offers and most plans exceed that.

MA plans offer add special benefits such as fitness centers and other activities. Vision, dental and hearing benefits that are not provided by Traditional Medicare

MA plans may have the same closed network but all plans have some minimal level of availability to primary care physicians.


### Medicare Part D

Prior to part D, medicare did not cover any cost of medications

Members may pay more to enroll in a part D plan

Stand-Alone part D or MA plan that includes part D coverage, this is referred to as a MAPD plan

CMS heavily regulates that plans that offer Part D. A significant part of Pharmacy department is devoted to meeting CMS requirements

Based on 5 star quality rating system


### Medicare Supplemental Plans (Med-Sup)
