# Lesson 7

## Skyrocketing costs

Bending the health cost curve
: Health costs have outpaced inflation. Some reason include ACA and other costly regulations. Decrease the rate at which health care spending goes up.

Health plans cost have been skyrocketing. 

## Cost Control Methodologies

1. Making sure services were medically necessary
2. Limiting access to services that are experimental or not necessary


The Direct approach: 
 * Require a referral to limit access to unnecessary or ineffective treatment
 * Closed network by stopping access to price hiked 

Indirect approach:
* Capitation 
    * Limiting physicians usage funds 

In the 1990's people started protesting capitations and state governments banned capitations 

Several physician organizations that accepted capitation could not cover the cost of care by the members went bankrupt

Today some of these methods are returning because the prices have once again raised at unsustainable levels for the average American

> For most of the lest 25 years the cost of health care has significantly exceeded the overall rate of inflation

> **Projection**
> Paying for medicare with increased health care costs could consume the entire federal budget

Wages have stalled while health costs have increased

Workable solutions are critical to maintain the industry 

## Wellness Movement

Employers encouraging their employees to live more health end up costing them less than paying for increased health costs

Most chronic and sudden illnesses are result of a personal lifestyle choice

Media is boosting the idea of healthy choices is both better for companies health care costs and better for the individuals lifestyle

## Cost Sharing

Those with health insurance have very little incentive to manage their health care wants. Oftentimes it is considered "free to me" and abuse the health care. 

Cost sharing reentered the health plan world in the 2000s for 2 reason
1. If the patient pays some then the monthly payment and premium goes down 
2. Financially patients will use fewer medical services. Only seeking necessary care.

Cost sharing restrain the growth of health insurance premiums for individuals and employers

 > The ACA puts restrictions on how much cost can be shared with the insured

High Deductible Health Plan
: **HDHP** a new method of addressing cost sharing. Starts as fee-for-service until member reaches large up-front deductible
