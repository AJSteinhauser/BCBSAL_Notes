# Lesson 2

## What is health insurance 

#### Person 1
Pays Hospital and drugs costs
Managed care to control costs and increase quality of health care
Must sign up for insurance prior to health emergency

#### Person 2

Enroll in health insurance plans in order to predict and normalize the cost of health care per year. 


Insurance
: Protection against loss
: Financial protection against loss or harm in return for the payment of a premium

Medical Coverage
: Doctor bills, diagnostic tests and pharmaceutical and hospital costs

Other types of health insurance 
* Disability 
* long-term care

Most people get health insurance through their employers known as group health insurance. 

*Once you enroll in a group plan, you cannot change to another plan until the next open enrollment season which is once a year*

Different options for different groups
* Managed Care
* Fee-For-Service insurance
* Dental insurance
* Vision insurance

When in group health insurance the employer usually pays a portion of the premium leading to lower costs for the individual


Group Membership
: Large groups benefit the individual however % of premium payed by organization varies 

Individual health insurance
: Purchase on your own from health insurance marketplace. They are responsible for paying the entire premium. Important to ensure the plan fits their needs. *The affordable care act sometimes helps people with premiums depending on income level*

Premium tax credit
: When going through **Individual health insurance** they may qualify for this. They can use all or a portion of their **Advanced premium tax credit (APTC)** to lower their premium costs. *Must not overcharge premium or they will have to pay the difference later*

Self-Employed
: Deduct their health insurance premiums from their federal taxable income providing them with savings. Most states offer similar tax preferences.

Contract:
: An agreement between the insurer and the insured is based on contract. An agreement with specific terms in return for a valuable benefit, known as consideration.

Health Insurance Policy
: A contract with health insurance. The consideration is the premium payments made by employer to insurer

Eligibility
: Identify who is able to get insured

Subscriber
: Person who buys or is provided insurance 

Dependant
: Other people who are covered by the subscriber 

Covered Service
: Insurance will pay for 

Exclusions
: Things the insurance company will not pay for

*Health insurance cover both preventive as well as reactive services*

Cost-sharing
: The insured can be expected to pay some but not all of the costs of medical care. The amount depends on how the policy is written.

Deductible
: Flat rate the insured must pay before the insurer will make any payments

Coinsurance
: The % of a medical bill that the insured is responsible for paying

Copayment
: Fixed about you agree to pay to receive benefit or coverage from insurance policy

#### Differences in selecting plans
* Individuals can choose a plan that covers the amount of coverage they want or need
* In employer sponsored plans they choose the the amount of coverage offered to their employees  
* Government sponsored plans
    * Medicare covers those > 65 and younger people with disabilities or severe kidney problems
    * Medicaid covers low income individuals

* Evidence of coverage booklet
    * Booklet from the insurance company, for all intents and purposes, it is the member contract
    * Identifies amount of care costs and amount of cost-sharing  

## The Health Insurance Contract

#### Risk
Insured individuals often expect insurance company to cover all procedures. However only things listed in contract are covered, if you want more coverage then you can pay more for a more inclusive coverage

Situations where health care services are not covered is hard for employee sponsored group health plan members. It is the duty of the companies HR to provide information about health care services to employees. 

**Most disagreements come from insured not reading or understanding their health care contract**

Some services may be explicits excluded from the health contract, experiments treatments, non-contracted provider, elective or cosmetic surgery 

**Experimental treatments are generally not covered by the health contract**
If every type of medical care was covered then the insurance company could not keep the price regulated as experimental treatments are expensive and not always worth the time or money. Insurance targets the general needs of a community not the far end of a bell curve 

Non-contracts providers
: Providers who do not have a contract with the the health insurance company and thus the health insurance plan will not cover care from that group


## Health care philosophy

Balancing the cost of care with the quality of health care. More expensive health care != higher quality of care

People want low cost high quality health care whenever they want. The balance must be struck between cost quality and access

Quality
: More care != better outcomes

Access
: Due to high costs of health care, without insurance health care is hard to get. Providers are more willing to provide care without upfront payment when you have an insurance plan

Cost
: Fee-For-Service providers get paid for each unit of medical service they provide

## Managed care and provider networks

Until the 1970's insurance could only improve two variables of the triangle at the same time. The federal government encourage the development of health maintenance organizations to improve all three variables at the same time...

How managed care improved health care: 

Cost 
: Created limited provider networks, paying physicians in different ways than fee-for-service and requiring referrals from a primary care doctor to get specialty care.

Quality
: Credentialing providers, enforcing evidence based medical policies, grading providers on their outcomes, and comparing providers results to their peers

Access
: As managed care improved both costs and quality, premium costs were controlled better and thus more accessible to the community 

Annual increase in premiums was a result of governmental limitations, higher provider fees, increased use of technology in delivery of care, health care fraud, and other administration costs

Provider networks
: Some plans require people to use doctors, hospitals, labs, pharmacies, and other providers that are "in" their proprietary networks

#### Categories of provider networks

Closed network
: Only providers that are within the network will be covered except in case of emergency

Open network 
: There is no limits on who can give you medical care
 
Defined network with out-of-network coverage
: Have a defined network to use, providers that are out of network will need to pay a higher amount of of costs 

#### Contract provider networks

Quality control
: Credentialing providers keeps malpractice out of network. Keeps quality up and costs lower for everyone 

Cost Control
: Negotiate fee payments for those in network in exchange for a higher patient volume. Makes cost more predictable

Addressing population health issues
: Focus on population health issues buy communication or with action/outcome based payment incentives

# Lesson 3

Health plans strive to give patients the "Right care, right setting, at the right time". They achieve this they structure the plan to support medical functions o achieving this goal

Breakdown of any parts of the triangle results in damage to other side of the triangle

Teams focused different aspects of the triangle

Cost
: Keep medical costs reasonable for clients

Access
: Improve accessability to medical care

Quality
: Improve the quality of medical services available to members

Medical department determines most of the patient affecting decisions are


## Clinical quality

Turing data into quality medical care
Clinical quality teams turn the data acquired from the insurance industry take the data and turn it into valuable information that allows companies to adjust insurance plans and coverage for the best possible output for those under their coverage

Evidence based medicine
: **EBM** from experimentation and and physician recommendations. Clinical quality teams use that data with a committee of physicians to debate, revise, and approve the health plans medical policies. 

Clinical Pathway
: A series of medical services for many conditions diseases and injuries, so the right care is almost always defined. **The right care means enough but not too much care**

Right Care
: Research has proven that more medical care is not necessarily better. Often times leads to lower costing care for the same output when the right amount of care is applied. 

Accreditation and quality scoring
: Undergoes screening of their operating procedures to determine if they meet the criteria as defined by the accrediting body

Accreditation
: Complex and includes audits that in compliance with state and federal regulations. They also establish requirements for health plan performance such as how clinical decisions are made, timely access to treatment, ext...

Government rating
: Medicare and medicaid services (CMS) bases its reimbursement based on "Star ratings program"

Star Ratings Program
: 0-5 stars in 45 areas that fall within several areas
    * Outcomes
    * intermediate outcomes
    * Patient experience 
    * Complains
    * Access
    * Process

## Utilization Management Function


Utilization Management Function
: **UM** team to explain and interpret medical polices set out by clinical team


Utilization Management Staff
: Registered nurses, physical therapist, social workers, and behavioral/mental health clinical 


Medical Necessity
: Services or supplies required to treat a certain medical condition approved by a doctor 
    * Drug 
    * Device
    * Treatment plan
    * other therapy


#### Medical Necessity Decision Flow

1. Gather medical information from providers office 
2. Identify best practices, match requested care to best practices treatment
3. Make Decision, made ultimately by medical plan's medical director (who are licensed physicians)
4. Communicate decision

Case Management
: Most UM departments have units devoted to this. Usually have additional accreditation than just register nurse. Help patients with acute or chronic illnesses and arrange/manage their medical care. Ideally have proactive outreach to chronically or acutely ill patients to ensure appropriate follow up

#### Case Management Decision Flow

1. Arrange Surgery
2. Arrange home care 
3. Arrange rehab and follow up visits
4. Optimal patient outcome 


Care management
: Cross between case management and population health management

Care manager act as both proactive and reactive resources for an insured population. It can be considered a Concierge-type service

##### Care management is valuable for 2 reason
1. Ensures broader application of right care, right setting, and right time
2. Personal touch may increase member satisfaction  

## Population Health Management  
**(PHM)**

80-20 Rule
: 20% of the members will account for 80% of the cost of medical care

Population Health Management
: Focus on improving the health and wellness of patients who suffer from chronic illness that put a large burden on the entire health care system 
* Often times insure agency's outsource this to PHM programs

PHM chronic illnesses:
* Diabetes
* Hypertension
* Asthma 
* Back pain
* High cholesterol 
* Depression 

PHM Staff Roles 
1. Identify Candidates  
2. Conduct outreach to engage them in proactively managing their chronic illness 
3. Handle acute episodes

PHM Theory
: Keeping members healthy is beneficial for both individuals and the greater health care community over the long run 

## Pharmacy Benefit Management 

In the last 20 years pharmacy costs have escalated dramatically. To combat this health plans rely on entities know as **Pharmacy Benefit Managers**

They are third party administrators for health plans that negotiate discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers, pharmacies, and keep list of covered prescription drugs **(Formulary)**

Most health plans have an internal pharmacy department staffed by licensed pharmacists. They set pharmacy policy and determines the health plans formulary

Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee
: Reviews and selects new and existing medications to be included in teh plan formulary based on safety and success criteria

Self-funded Medical coverage
: Employers will sometimes self fund specific non formulary drugs. They PBM will look at costs and recommend changes to health plans to enable the employers to offer that specific treatment 


# Lesson 4


## Backbone Functions

Non-medical backbone functions support the delivery of health care to the insured. Every employee medical or otherwise receives a paycheck because to provide health services for customers. Each interaction with the insured effects the plans reputation and ability to attract new members.

Customer
: Anyone who receives a product, service, or information

3 Types of customers 
1. **Internal customers** -  Colleagues in other departments that you hand your work off to.
2. **Intermediate customers** - Individuals, or organizations that your company works with on how to provide services on your behalf to the ultimate customer. 
3. **External customers** - The members that you serve

*Customers can fit into more than one category at a time*

> Even if you are not serving an external customer, your job is to provide services to someone who is!

## Network Management

Functions provided by the network management team
1. Initial recruitment of providers
2. Education of contracted providers
3. Solving customer issues

Network Recruitment
: Reaching out of physicians and other medical providers within the service area to encourage then to sign a contract with the health plan

Network Analyst
: Use data to determine what medical providers are necessary to ensure health care is high quality

Network Recruitment and Contracting 
: After need is established staff members use a marketing plan to identify why the provider would benefit from aligning with the health plan

Provider Contract Contains
 * How much and basis how payment
 * Requirements for abiding by the plans clinical policies
 * Proper billing services
 * Rules for making referrals within the plans network


Independent Practice Association
: **(IPA)** handle the contracting of practices directly 


Provider Relations Team
* Provide training on clinical polices and other health plan business issues
* Build relationships with providers and their office staff. 
* Handle provider calls take inbound provider calls tend to be more difficult issues that require additional research
* Resolve tough issues often times work with multiple organizations within the health plan 

## Member Relations

Several departments involved with member relations some include 

* Enrollment
* Claims
* Customer Service or Member Service
* Appeals


### Enrollment
Produce ID cards the "ticket" to health services 
Oftentimes a customer impression of the entire health plan is impacted by the Enrollment team to perform job well.

Enrollment Process Flow
1. Application 
2. Data Entry 
3. ID Card distribution

Electronic Data Interchange
: **(EDI)** enrollments that com in electronically 

*Enrollment and ID card functions are oftentimes outsources to other companies*  


### Claims

After the enrollment the claims department deals with provider bills and other health care payments

Bills
: Bills are received both electronically, mail, fax and it is the job of claims to make sure they are all dealt with in a reasonable time period

Electronic Billing
: Staff members ensure smooth receipt and processing of electronic billing

Automated Processing
: Health plan claims system generally process a high percentage of electronic submission automatically without claims examiner involvement 

Paper Claims
: Loaded into the claim system manually using scanner and filling in missing information. 

First-Pass
: Automatically denied and require a claim examiner intervention to be payed

Explanation of Benefits
: Every time a claim is payed this document is sent to the insured explaining their benefits. *Often times the top line says "THIS IS NOT A BILL"*

Claims Adjudication 
: review processing and payment 

The more times members contact a claims department, the worse they are doing.

### Customer(/Member) Service  

When a insured person calls their health plan, they connect with customer service. This is where the majority of direct customer interactions happen.

Databases have made the job of customer services a lot easier and them able to provide accurate information to the caller

**Angry callers**

Customer services must be at their best because the callers are oftentimes distraught about the status of their health

## Appeals

A request that the health plan reconsider a coverage decision. This department is generally staffed by registered nurses or doctors

## Administrative Functions

Health plans need other staff to handle other administrative requests
* Information Technology 
    * Not the goal of a health care system, but in todays world it is almost impossible to service clients well without a robust technical system 
* Finance
    * Need accounting, billing, and accounts payable function
    * Provide financial insight into the well being of the company
    * Provide reports to federal and state legislators 
* Legal Guidance 
    * Shepherding a new contract through state regulatory process may require experience attorney due to complexity of regulations and laws
* Human Resources
    * Recruiters important to keep the staff strong 


# Lesson 5
## Actuarial Department 

Decide the plans offered at what price by looking at statistical data, paired with financial theory. They put financial safeguards in place to ensure that the plan is viable for the company and thus the individual.


Risk
: Members of the plan will become injured or ill and need services the insurance company must pay for.

Actuaries assess the risk and set prices accordingly.

**Actuary Responsibilities:**
* Design plan benefits 
* Determine insurance premiums
* Monitor company profit
* Recommend corrective action 
* Ensure funds are set aside to pay claims

Risk Calculation Simplified
`Risk = Probability of something bad * expected cost of something bad` 

Forecasting
: Accurately predicting the health care expenses for setting premiums, based on historical claims and medical trend data.

**Pricing based on 3 financial considerations:**
1. Expected medical costs
2. Budgeted administrative costs
3. Desired net profit tax

Rate filings
: In a lot states, insurance companies must file their proposed premium rates with state regulatory agencies *Can also be annual filing if the plan increasing regularly*

If forecasting is accurate then the premiums are appropriately priced and the health plan succeeds in their financial goals.


## Underwriting 

Book of Business
: Set of accounts overseen by a underwriter

The goal of an underwriter is to grow the size of the book by adding new members. Sell the plan new groups or new people under an old group. 

Book rate
: Recommendation the health plan should charge for coverage 

Different premiums exists based on employer group size, industry, previous health experience or other factors, it is the underwriting department that is responsible applying the variables to the book rate

Experience Rating
: Premiums based on what the groups claim history has looked like over time. With larger groups the more variability the premium will have from the book rate, the opposite from small groups

Some states allow for adjustment of book rate based on age and gender profile. They also adjust premium accounts based on the industry of the category of the employer. Some are much more likely to use a bigger % of insurance.

Affordable Care Act
: Insures are not allowed discriminate against individuals with pre-existing medical conditions

`Good underwriting does not mean premiums don't increase. It means that the are more stable over time allowing companies and families to plan their health financial needs`

## Product Development 

Determines the type of benefit plans that members have access to.

Product Mix
: Different plans to appeal to as many potential customers as possible

Lead time to make a new product is very long. Forecasting must be accurate 1 - 2 years into the future in order to keep the plan financially stable.

Plan Variation is based on customers demand. Oftentimes balancing is based on co-pay vs monthly rates.

**Product development involves several cross functional teams:**
1. Estimate Costs
    * Work with actuarial department
2. Determine plan appeal
    * Communication staff will do a focus group to see if appeal exists
3. Attain regulatory approval
    * Finance and legal department manage the plan through state approval process  
4. Develop a marketing plan
    * Marketing team to explain plan to buyers

`Good performance = profit`


## Marketing

Collateral materials
: Flyer, folder, booklets, and other expendable materials designed to explain plan and their benefits. 

The goal is to be clear and concise messaging about each plan and their variations.

**The health insurance industry is oftentimes th subject of negative news and political attack**

The insurance company is usually the ones blamed when customers feel their out of pocket costs are too high.

Marketing spend a lot of time explaining value to customers in the face of negative attacks both politically and in the news.

## Sales

A plan is no good if there are no sales no matter how good the value.

`The goal is to retain and grow the health plan`

Primary targeting business that don't offer the companies insurance yet.

Different agents are trained and experienced with different sized groups to sell to.

Independent brokers
: Companies have agreements with individual to represent them with insurance companies

Major/National account sales tend to use consultants to compare insurance options. These deals tend to takes months if not years to finalize.

Account managers
: Primary goal is the maintenance and renewal of existing accounts. They must understand the clients business in order to tweak their plan to keep costs down.

Individual sales
: Some states can sell directly to individual customers, most medicare advantages sales are in this category.

Individual sales agent must sift through numerous medicare options, match them to the needs of the client and make recommendation that best meets the needs of the client.

# Lesson 6

## Overview

HIPPA
: Health insurance portability and accountability act

Public Good
: A good every American has the right to receive

Vested Interest
: Governmental agencies regulate health care to protect consumers

The size of insurance industry is a reason for the scrutiny of the industry

`Health care accounts for 17% of Americas GDP and is expected to hit over 19%`

Reserve Requirements
: Statues that require health insurance plans to keep a defined amount of money in reserve

Types of regulation: 
* Laws and regulations 
* Benefit mandates 

Benefit mandates, should the free market decide if a medical service is to be covered by competing insurers


## Federal Regulations 

Employee Retirement Income Security Act
: **ERISA** employers have a fiduciary responsibility to administer employee benefit plans

ERISA Impacts 2 areas:
1. Payment of claims
    * Defined process that must be available for appealing denied claims 
2. Self-funded plan 
    * Gives employers the option to provide health coverage to employees self funded. Exempt from a lot of local and state regulations

Affordable Care Act
: **ACA** Signed into law by Obama in 2010  

Many laws have had many impacts far beyond the original health plan scope.

## Medicare and Medicaid

Federal government funds medicare and provides substantial funds medicaid.

Center for medicare and Medicaid services
: **CMS** Governmental agency that oversees Medicare and Medicaid as well as quality standards and clinical laboratory quality standards

CMS issues regulations and guidelines that incorporate the law. They also deal with benefit mandates and issue regulations dealing with criminal penalties.

Codes of conduct
: health plan requirements to protect the health plan and it management from facing criminal charges in the event of errors in following the CMS rules

If a health plan does not comply then they are not allowed to market their plan legally.

## State Regulations

Regulation of insurance companies is almost exclusively conducted at the state level.

Each state maintains a separate administrative agency within the executive branch to regulate insurance.

* Responsibilities 
    * Must oversee and regulate th marketing, solicitations and sale of insurance products
* Name
    * Usually called Department of Insurance. The head official is usually called the Insurance Commissioner
* Regulations
    * The creates a group of administrative regulations and hires regulators who manage licensing and disciplining of insurance agents and agencies.
* Licensing
    * Most states require prospective agents to pass exam to prior to licensing. Continues eduction to maintain their license 
* Standards
    * Minimum reserve, liquidity, financial strength

Most of state government legislation qualify as benefit mandates. This is because of state government is more welcoming of advocacy groups that push for condition specific benefit mandates.

Each state may have its own reporting requirements many states work under the parameters as National Association of Insurance Commissioners **NAIC**

Regulatory Tools
* Control the definitions of terms
    * Pre-existing conditions can mean different things in different states
* Timeliness 
* Unfairly denying claims

The goal of regulation is protect consumers by preventing unfair practices.

Most states enforce their laws through insurance commissions. They can levy fines, and suspend or revoke licenses.

Insured can complain to state insurance commissioner about as a check  

## Net Effect

The more expensive it is for a company to operate, the more expensive it will be for customers

Regulators must find balance between free market ideals and customer protection

# Lesson 7

## Skyrocketing costs

Bending the health cost curve
: Health costs have outpaced inflation. Some reason include ACA and other costly regulations. Decrease the rate at which health care spending goes up.

Health plans cost have been skyrocketing. 

## Cost Control Methodologies

1. Making sure services were medically necessary
2. Limiting access to services that are experimental or not necessary


The Direct approach: 
 * Require a referral to limit access to unnecessary or ineffective treatment
 * Closed network by stopping access to price hiked 

Indirect approach:
* Capitation 
    * Limiting physicians usage funds 

In the 1990's people started protesting capitations and state governments banned capitations 

Several physician organizations that accepted capitation could not cover the cost of care by the members went bankrupt

Today some of these methods are returning because the prices have once again raised at unsustainable levels for the average American

> For most of the lest 25 years the cost of health care has significantly exceeded the overall rate of inflation

> **Projection**
> Paying for medicare with increased health care costs could consume the entire federal budget

Wages have stalled while health costs have increased

Workable solutions are critical to maintain the industry 

## Wellness Movement

Employers encouraging their employees to live more health end up costing them less than paying for increased health costs

Most chronic and sudden illnesses are result of a personal lifestyle choice

Media is boosting the idea of healthy choices is both better for companies health care costs and better for the individuals lifestyle

## Cost Sharing

Those with health insurance have very little incentive to manage their health care wants. Oftentimes it is considered "free to me" and abuse the health care. 

Cost sharing reentered the health plan world in the 2000s for 2 reason
1. If the patient pays some then the monthly payment and premium goes down 
2. Financially patients will use fewer medical services. Only seeking necessary care.

Cost sharing restrain the growth of health insurance premiums for individuals and employers

 > The ACA puts restrictions on how much cost can be shared with the insured

High Deductible Health Plan
: **HDHP** a new method of addressing cost sharing. Starts as fee-for-service until member reaches large up-front deductible

## Wellness/CS HC Synergy

Super basic, no notes needed

# Lesson 8

## Differentiation

* Pricing
* Quality of customer service
* Internet access
* Geographic coverage area
* Details of the products offered

> The biggest differentiation a plan can make is with its benefits plan

## Commercial Products

Can be sold individually or as a group plan.

**Types of commercial products:**
* Managed Care
    * HMO, EPO, accessible network medical services is very strict. 
* PPO preferred provider organization
    * Allowing both in-network and out-network coverage for health care
* Fee for service
     * Reimburses the patient or provider as expenses are incurred. 

~*Hybrid plans are growing in popularity*~

Consumer-driven health care
: **(CDHC)** Plans that allow HSA or HRA to pay providers directly for their health needs

**How CDHC works:**
1. Client puts aside money is savings plan
2. Expenses will come from their pre-funded spending account
3. If the amount of money is > than the amount set aside, then the member pays regular deductible 
4. If there is unused balance then it rolls over into the next year.
5. HDHP protects them from catastrophic medical expenses

## Government programs/products    

### Traditional Medicare

For people > 65 years old or those who are permanently disabled and those with end-stage renal disease

It is essentially a fee for service plan. It is over seen by **CMS** health insured plans are hired by cms to process and pay the claims from medical providers. They do not take on insurance risk, only administrative services

Medicare Advantage (Part C)
: They can opt for coverage through a private company that offers MA plans. CMS regulates these plans carefully

Often times no premium. May be structured on HMO or PPO plans.
MA plans are required by law to offer at minimum all benefits that medicare offers and most plans exceed that.

MA plans offer add special benefits such as fitness centers and other activities. Vision, dental and hearing benefits that are not provided by Traditional Medicare

MA plans may have the same closed network but all plans have some minimal level of availability to primary care physicians.


### Medicare Part D

Prior to part D, medicare did not cover any cost of medications

Members may pay more to enroll in a part D plan

Stand-Alone part D or MA plan that includes part D coverage, this is referred to as a MAPD plan

CMS heavily regulates that plans that offer Part D. A significant part of Pharmacy department is devoted to meeting CMS requirements

Based on 5 star quality rating system


### Medicare Supplemental Plans (Med-Sup)

Standardized plans whose benefits are determined by the federal government. They provide assistance with the coverage of costs that Traditional Medicare does not cover. Many health plans also develop Med-Sup plans still with tight CMS oversight


### Medicaid

Federal-State partnership program for health coverage of low income families

* State prescribes what level of benefit the plan must offer
* Some health plans started exclusively to cover medicaid
* Medicaid-Medicare hybrid in low income old populations (Double eligible)

Duel Eligibility
: Can have both medicare and medicaid coverage at the same time

### Children's health insurance program

 **CHIP** coverage to families with children

Designed to cover uninsured children in families with modest incomes but too high to qualify for medicaid

Many health plans that provide medicaid plans also cover CHIP plans.

> The employees in CHIP and Medicaid must pay extra attention to ensure they get the care they need.

### TRICARE

Health care for service members and their families. Both retired and active.

It is managed by DOD. Utilizes commercial health insurance 

### Federal employee health benefits plan (FEHBP)

Umbrella term for health coverage for government employees

Paid for by the government but acts just like a commercial employer provided health plan.

Requires the premium rate for its coverage to be the lowest provided rate the health plan offers.

## Funding Options

Fully insured premium funding
: specific monthly premium in exchange for health coverage

Minimum premium plans
: The health plan agrees to share with employer any savings above what was expected in medical costs

Self-funded plan
: Employer groups and union groups; the employer takes on all medical cost risks and pay a health plan to administer the coverage


# Lesson 9

Primary Customers
: The individuals who hae th most contact with the staff of a health plan. 

Commercial Members
: The customer calls their HR dept who would call the health plan they act as intermediate customer

Satisfaction surveys
: Members complete them and government and accreditation agencies review them 

Vote for renewal
: Employer groups don't get surveys but once a year get to vote on renewing the current health plan

Employers often use insurance agents or brokers to shop for insurance on their behalf

Sales team must work with broker to access employer

Consultants act like brokers and provide options for health insurance companies 

Office of Personnel Management
: **OPM** acts as governments HR department 

> Government is both a customer of health plans and a regulator

Department of Insurance at the state level offers licensing but they are also customers of the government

**Quality indicators:**
* Maintaining a minimum # of providers
* Turn around times for patient appointments
* Ensuring payments are made in timely fashion
* Financial reserves

## Managed Care and Provider Networks

Hospitals, physicians, pharmacies, and ancillary providers make up the second most contact with health plans

Provider groups are constantly reaching out to health plans 
Medical providers are under contract with health plan to provide services at a constant rate

Representatives from provider groups may be members of the health plans committees. Providers and health plans have a deeply interconnected relationship that must be respected to succeed

## Management / Board 

Management is also subject to oversight from the board of directors

Not for profit
: The board determines the reasons for the organizations existence

For Profit
: Represent the shareholders of the stock of the company

Frequently board members serve multiple roles as customer or provider 

## Internal Customers

Member of the plan
: You are probably a member of the plan making you a great tester of the plan

Internal Customer
:  You are an internal customer to help an external customer or to assist a coworker
