# Lesson 5
## Actuarial Department 

Decide the plans offered at what price by looking at statistical data, paired with financial theory. They put financial safeguards in place to ensure that the plan is viable for the company and thus the individual.


Risk
: Members of the plan will become injured or ill and need services the insurance company must pay for.

Actuaries assess the risk and set prices accordingly.

**Actuary Responsibilities:**
* Design plan benefits 
* Determine insurance premiums
* Monitor company profit
* Recommend corrective action 
* Ensure funds are set aside to pay claims

Risk Calculation Simplified
`Risk = Probability of something bad * expected cost of something bad` 

Forecasting
: Accurately predicting the health care expenses for setting premiums, based on historical claims and medical trend data.

**Pricing based on 3 financial considerations:**
1. Expected medical costs
2. Budgeted administrative costs
3. Desired net profit tax

Rate filings
: In a lot states, insurance companies must file their proposed premium rates with state regulatory agencies *Can also be annual filing if the plan increasing regularly*

If forecasting is accurate then the premiums are appropriately priced and the health plan succeeds in their financial goals.


## Underwriting 

Book of Business
: Set of accounts overseen by a underwriter

The goal of an underwriter is to grow the size of the book by adding new members. Sell the plan new groups or new people under an old group. 

Book rate
: Recommendation the health plan should charge for coverage 

Different premiums exists based on employer group size, industry, previous health experience or other factors, it is the underwriting department that is responsible applying the variables to the book rate

Experience Rating
: Premiums based on what the groups claim history has looked like over time. With larger groups the more variability the premium will have from the book rate, the opposite from small groups

Some states allow for adjustment of book rate based on age and gender profile. They also adjust premium accounts based on the industry of the category of the employer. Some are much more likely to use a bigger % of insurance.

Affordable Care Act
: Insures are not allowed discriminate against individuals with pre-existing medical conditions

`Good underwriting does not mean premiums don't increase. It means that the are more stable over time allowing companies and families to plan their health financial needs`

## Product Development 

Determines the type of benefit plans that members have access to.

Product Mix
: Different plans to appeal to as many potential customers as possible

Lead time to make a new product is very long. Forecasting must be accurate 1 - 2 years into the future in order to keep the plan financially stable.

Plan Variation is based on customers demand. Oftentimes balancing is based on co-pay vs monthly rates.

**Product development involves several cross functional teams:**
1. Estimate Costs
    * Work with actuarial department
2. Determine plan appeal
    * Communication staff will do a focus group to see if appeal exists
3. Attain regulatory approval
    * Finance and legal department manage the plan through state approval process  
4. Develop a marketing plan
    * Marketing team to explain plan to buyers

`Good performance = profit`


## Marketing
